# Go Deep Learning — Getting Started Guide

> This guide is for **complete beginners** who have never written Go code before.

---

## How This Guide Works

This guide teaches Go by building up concepts **gradually**. Each topic builds on previous ones.

### The Learning Path

```
START HERE (Foundations)
    ↓
    ├── 01: Go Toolchain      ← Set up your environment
    └── 02: Variables         ← Basic building blocks
    
    ↓
    
BASIC DATA STRUCTURES
    ├── 03: Arrays & Slices   ← Ordered collections
    ├── 04: Maps              ← Key-value storage
    └── 05: Structs & Methods ← Custom data types
    
    ↓
    
TYPE SYSTEM
    ├── 06: Pointers          ← Memory addresses
    └── 07: Interfaces        ← Polymorphism

ADVANCED: CONCURRENCY (Go's killer feature)
    ├── 10: Goroutines       ← Lightweight threads
    ├── 11: Channels         ← Communication between goroutines

## Before You Start

### 1. Install Go

```bash
# Check if Go is installed
go version

# If not installed, download from: https://go.dev/doc/install
# Or use your package manager:
# macOS: brew install go
# Linux: sudo apt install golang
# Windows: Download installer from go.dev
```

### 2. Create Your Workspace

```bash
# Create a folder for learning Go
mkdir -p ~/go-learning
cd ~/go-learning
```

### 3. Verify Installation

Create a file called `hello.go`:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, Go!")
}
```

Run it:

```bash
go run hello.go
```

You should see: `Hello, Go!`

**Congratulations!** You've written your first Go program.

## How to Study Each Topic

### Step 1: Read the Theory

Read each markdown file from top to bottom. Don't skip sections.

### Step 2: Try the Examples

Copy each code example and run it on your machine. Don't just read — **write code**.

### Step 3: Test Your Understanding

At the end of each file, there are "Quick Reference" sections. Try to explain each concept out loud.

### Step 4: Solve Exercises

Look for "Common Pitfalls" sections — these teach by showing what **not** to do.

### Step 5: Revisit

After learning new topics, come back to earlier ones. You'll understand them better.

## Essential Commands Reference

### Running Code

```bash
go run hello.go        # Run a single file
go build hello.go      # Compile to binary
go build -o myapp .    # Build and name the binary
./myapp                # Run the compiled binary
```

### Testing

```bash
go test ./...          # Run all tests
go test -v             # Verbose output
go test -race          # Check for race conditions
go test -cover         # Show coverage
```

### Getting Help

```bash
go doc fmt.Println    # View documentation
go doc -all sync       # View all docs for a package
go help go.mod         # Get help on a command
```

---

## Prerequisites

Before starting, you should know:

- **Basic programming concepts**: What is a variable? What is a function?
- **Command line basics**: How to navigate folders, run commands
- **Text editor**: VS Code, GoLand, or any editor you prefer

You **don't** need to know:
- Any specific programming language
- Memory management
- Concurrency concepts

## Study Tips

### Rule 1: Don't Rush

If something doesn't make sense, re-read it. If it still doesn't make sense, check the "Common Pitfalls" section.

### Rule 2: Write Code

Reading alone won't teach you. After each concept, write your own example.

### Rule 3: Ask Questions

If you're stuck:
1. Check Go's official docs: https://go.dev/doc/
2. Search on Stack Overflow
3. Check Go by Example: https://gobyexample.com/

### Rule 4: Take Breaks

If you're confused, take a break. Come back later with fresh eyes.
